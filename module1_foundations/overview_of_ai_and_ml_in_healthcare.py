```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def run():
    print("Module 1: Overview of AI and ML in Healthcare")

    # This is a placeholder for the actual content of the module.
    # In the actual implementation, this could be a series of lessons, exercises, or projects.
    # For example, you might have a lesson on the basics of AI and ML,
    # followed by an exercise where students apply these concepts to a healthcare problem.

    # Lesson: Basics of AI and ML
    print("\nLesson: Basics of AI and ML")
    print("In this lesson, we will explore the basics of AI and ML...")

    # Exercise: Applying AI and ML to a Healthcare Problem
    print("\nExercise: Applying AI and ML to a Healthcare Problem")
    print("In this exercise, you will apply AI and ML concepts to a healthcare problem...")
    # Note: In the actual implementation, you would provide the problem and the instructions for the exercise.
    # For the purpose of this example, we will just simulate the exercise with a simple pandas operation.

    # Placeholder for pandas operation
    df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(0,100,size=(100, 4)), columns=list('ABCD'))
    print(df.head())
