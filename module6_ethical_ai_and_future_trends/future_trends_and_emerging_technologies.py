    # This is a placeholder for the actual content of the module.
    # In the actual implementation, this could be a series of lessons, exercises, or projects.
    # For example, you might have a lesson on the future trends in healthcare AI,
    # followed by an exercise where students research and present on an emerging technology in healthcare AI.

    # Lesson: Future Trends in Healthcare AI
    print("\nLesson: Future Trends in Healthcare AI")
    print("In this lesson, we will explore the future trends in healthcare AI...")

    # Exercise: Research and Presentation on an Emerging Technology in Healthcare AI
    print("\nExercise: Research and Presentation on an Emerging Technology in Healthcare AI")
    print("In this exercise, you will research and present on an emerging technology in healthcare AI...")
    # Note: In the actual implementation, you would provide the instructions for the research and presentation exercise.
