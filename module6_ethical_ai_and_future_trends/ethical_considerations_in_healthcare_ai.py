    # In the actual implementation, this could be a series of lessons, exercises, or projects.
    # For example, you might have a lesson on the ethical considerations in healthcare AI,
    # followed by an exercise where students analyze a healthcare AI system with ethical considerations.

    # Note: In the actual implementation, the exercise would involve a more complex analysis of the AI system,
    # taking into account ethical considerations such as fairness, transparency, and accountability.
