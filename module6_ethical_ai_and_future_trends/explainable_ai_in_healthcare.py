    # followed by an exercise where students explore techniques for making AI models more interpretable.

    # For example, they might use a decision tree classifier to predict treatment outcome based on age and condition,
    # and then use a technique like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the model.
    # Note: This is just a simulation. In the actual implementation, you would use a real ML library and dataset.
