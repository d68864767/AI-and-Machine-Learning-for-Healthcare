# Master Class Project: AI and Machine Learning for Healthcare

This project is a comprehensive master class on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) with healthcare. Over the course of several months, participants will learn and apply advanced AI and ML techniques to solve complex problems in the healthcare domain.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into six modules, each focusing on a different aspect of AI and ML in healthcare. Each module contains several Python scripts that cover different topics.
