    # For example, you might have a lesson on the basics of genomic data,
    # followed by an exercise where students analyze a genomic dataset using pandas.

    # Lesson: Basics of Genomic Data
    print("\nLesson: Basics of Genomic Data")

    # Exercise: Analyzing a Genomic Dataset
    print("\nExercise: Analyzing a Genomic Dataset")
    print("In this exercise, you will analyze a genomic dataset using pandas...")
    # Note: In the actual implementation, you would provide the dataset and the instructions for the exercise.

    # Lesson: Genomic Data Preprocessing
    print("\nLesson: Genomic Data Preprocessing")
    print("In this lesson, we will learn about preprocessing techniques for genomic data...")

    # Exercise: Preprocessing a Genomic Dataset
