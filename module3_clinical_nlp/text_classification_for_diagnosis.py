    # followed by an exercise where students build a text classifier for medical diagnosis.

    # Lesson: Basics of Text Classification
    print("\nLesson: Basics of Text Classification")

    # Here is a simplified example of how you might implement the exercise:

    # Load the dataset
    # Note: In the actual implementation, you would load a real dataset.
    # For this example, we will use a dummy dataset.
    texts = ["The patient has a fever and cough.", "The patient has a headache.", "The patient has a rash."]

    # Split the dataset into training and testing sets

    # Vectorize the texts
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
    train_texts_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_texts)
    test_texts_vec = vectorizer.transform(test_texts)

    # Train the classifier
    classifier = MultinomialNB()
    classifier.fit(train_texts_vec, train_labels)

    # Test the classifier
    predictions = classifier.predict(test_texts_vec)

    # Print the accuracy
